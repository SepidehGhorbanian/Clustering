# Mall Costumers Clustering


## Project Intro
The purpose of this project is to cluster the costumers of a mall using different clustering algorithms and visualizing the results.

### Methods Used
* Data Preprocessing
* Machine Learning (Clustering algorithms)
* Visualization

### Technologies
* [Python](https://www.python.org/)
* [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
* [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)
* [Scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/)
* [Scipy](https://scipy.org/)
* [Numpy](https://numpy.org/)

## Project Description
Clustering is an unsupervised method of machine learning. It is the task of dividing the population or data points into a number of groups such that data points in the same groups are more similar to other data points in the same group than those in other groups. 

Clustering the costumers helps to better understand them, in terms of both static demographics and dynamic behaviors and it has several benefits for the business purposes like better positioning of products or messaging.

Some of the most important clustering algorithms are K-Means, DBSCAN and Hierarchical. These algorithms have been implemented in this project on the same dataset. The difference in their results is clearly shown by visualizing the results.

## Getting Started

1. Download and install python on your computer
2. Make sure to install libraries that have been mentioned before in the 'Technologies' section of the text, if you don't already have them
3. You can either directly download this repo or clone it (for help see this [tutorial](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/)) 
4. The Mall_Costumers dataset is stored [here](https://github.com/Unisepp/Clustering/blob/main/Clustering/Mall_Customers.csv)
5. Data processing and transformation scripts are being kept [here](https://github.com/Unisepp/Clustering/blob/main/Clustering/Clustering.py)
6. Run the code in python and see the results
