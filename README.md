Using the K_Means algorithm from clustering algorithms (unsupervised) 
The code is in Python and it is using the Scikit-learn (Sklearn) library
Dataset: The mall costumers dataset

Step 1: Importing and understanding the dataset
The data includes the following features: Customer ID - Customer Gender - Customer Age - Annual Income of the customer - Spending score of the customer

Step 2: Preparing the data by selecting 2 chosen features (annual income and spending score)

Step 3: Finding the optimal number of K for k_means using the elbow curve: The best value of k appears when the value of 'WCSS' slowly stops decreasing

Step 4: Fitting the algorithm to the dataset

Step 5: Plotting and visulazing to show the result
